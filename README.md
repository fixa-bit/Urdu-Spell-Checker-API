# Urdu Spell Checker API

## Overview
This Flask-based API is designed to provide spelling suggestions and corrections for Urdu text. It leverages several Python libraries, including NumPy, difflib, and Pandas, to analyze input words and generate the most probable corrections based on various edit distances and frequency data. The API is capable of handling insertions, deletions, replacements, and swaps of characters in the words.

## Features
- **Spelling correction** based on known word frequencies and edit distances.
- **Word suggestions** using difflib and custom algorithms for closest matches.
- **Handling different types of edits**, including deletions, insertions, replacements, and swaps.
- **Integration with a dictionary** to suggest only valid Urdu words.

## Libraries Used

- `numpy`: For efficient numerical operations.
- `difflib`: To calculate similarities between sequences.
- `pandas`: For handling data in structured formats.
- `csv`: For reading and writing CSV files.
- `re`: For regular expression operations.
- `collections.Counter`: For counting the frequency of words.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Flask
## Core Logic

The spell checker works through a series of steps:

1. **Candidate Generation:**
   - **`candidate6xspace`**: Generated by checking known words after applying single-edit operations.
   - **`candidate2del`**: Words generated by deleting characters.
   - **`candidate2replace`**: Words generated by replacing characters.
   - **`candidate2insert`**: Words generated by inserting characters.
   - **`candidate3`**: Words generated by applying two-edit operations.
   - **`candidate5`**: Words generated by swapping adjacent characters.

2. **Filtering Candidates:**
   - Each candidate set is filtered to ensure only valid words are considered. This is achieved using the `filter_word` function, which compares candidates against the original word and categorizes them based on the type of edit (`delete`, `replace`, `insert`, or `swap`).

3. **Suggestions:**
   - The API computes the best match by comparing the input word with the generated candidates using edit distances and word frequencies.
